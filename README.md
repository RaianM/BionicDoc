Bionic Reading is a reading method invented by Swiss Developer Renato Casuut. By bolding the intial part of a word, readers find themselves getting through texts quicker and with more focus. This algorithm takes in a Microsoft Word document and bolds the first half of every word in order to simulate a more intense Bionic Reading.
